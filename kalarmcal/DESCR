This library provides access to KAlarm calendar data, but not to the storage
of the data, which is handled by Akonadi (or by build option, KResources).
The main class, KAEvent represents a KAlarm event, and contains both the
event definition including the main alarm and optional subsidiary alarms, and
status information about the event.

Calendar format information is accessed through the KACalendar class, which
provides read and write access to the calendar format version and
iCalendar product ID.
